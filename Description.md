#Top Level
 1. The platform will be based on cloud as well as offline operations. 
 2. Modules:
 - Projects Module( This will be used to manage all the Projects:
  - Management and Administration of the platform 
  - Design
  - Development 
  - Deployment 
  - Lifecycle Support
 - Systems Engineering Modules( For each project, these modules will interact with Projects module for closed interaction):
  - System Design
  - Technical Management 
  - Product Realisation
 3. Core Structure:
  - Data (Database,  Data storage, Backup etc.)
  - Core Tools(Initially opensource tools used to develop the core tools and then the core tools will be used for further development of new products
   - Software Development tool
   - Hardware Design and Development tool
   - CAD tool( 2d and 3d models development)
   - Systems Engineering tool
   - Publications tools
   - Modelling and Simulations tool
  - UI for using the tools and management of the platform. 
   - The development of any new product as well as of the platform will be a continuous collaborative effort.
Note: The above mentioned details are a rough description of requirements and functionality and would be formalized as per Systems Engineering model
 The Systems approach would be at the heart of the platform and hence it will manifest in how the platform evolves and the products which come out of it.

 4. Stake Holders:
   - Industry
   - you 
   - People with experience and expertise in their personal capacities 
   - Educational institutions 
   - Government 
   - Research Establishments

 5. The platform would be modular for supporting concurrent development. Still the modules would be able to interact and access each other for accelelerated maturity of the platform.
